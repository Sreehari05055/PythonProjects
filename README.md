# 1) Credential_gui.py :  This is a Python script that implements a credential management system with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The system allows users to login, signup, and reset their passwords. It uses a text file to store user credentials, which are encrypted using ROT13. The system also sends a one-time password (OTP) to the user's email address for password reset.
# 2) Cat_shelter.py : This program, cat_shelter.py, is a command-line application that processes cat activity records stored in daily text files. Each file contains one line per cat activity, with entry and departure times represented in minutes since midnight. The program can be run with a specific daily file as an argument, such as python3 cat_shelter.py cat_shelter_1.txt, to analyze the records for that day.
