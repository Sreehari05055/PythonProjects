# 1) Credential_gui.py :  This project is a simple user authentication system using Python and MySQL. It allows users to sign up, log in, and reset their passwords. The passwords are encoded using the ROT13 algorithm. 
     The system also includes functionality for sending an OTP (One-Time Password) via email for password reset purposes.
      1) Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
      2) Create a database named 'credentials'
      3) Modify the connection parameters (host, user, password, database) in the script to match your MySQL setup.
      4) install MySQL connector 'pip install mysql-connector-python'.
      5) Update the database connection details in the script (host, user, password), and you can proceed to run the script in your Python environment

     
# 2) Cat_shelter.py : This program (an Academic project), cat_shelter.py, is a command-line application that processes cat activity records stored in daily text files. Each file contains one line per cat activity, with entry and departure times represented in minutes since midnight. The program can be run with a specific daily file as an argument, such as 'python3 cat_shelter.py cat_shelter_1.txt', to analyze the records for that day.
