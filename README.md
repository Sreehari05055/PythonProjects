# 1) Credential_gui.py :  This is a Python script that implements a credential management system with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The system allows users to login, signup, and reset their passwords. It uses a text file to store user credentials, which are encrypted using ROT13. The system also sends a one-time password (OTP) to the user's email address for password reset.
# 2) Cat_shelter.py : a program that handles records of a cat when it entered and when it left and also whether the cat was an intruder. One line is written for every cat activity, so a single line contains both the entry and departure times. Times are stored as minutes, with a start of midnight. So midnight would be represented as zero, 1am is 60, and 9:30am would be 570 (9 x 60 + 30). There is one file created each day and there are 3 text files for 3 days. The following program works on the command line output on typing "python3 cat_shelter.py cat_shelter_1.txt" the text file 1 could be replaced with the other 2.
calculator.py: is a simple calculator gui that handles basic functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
